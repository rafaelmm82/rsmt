## Ideas and Insights to Try

- **Multiple perforations**. When trying to create proxies with more than one perforation zone, try to do that in vertical and horizontal to simulate both types of wells (classical vertical and the new horizontal).
- **Vectorial input**. Change the vector input to represent data for forecasting production

- **CNNs**, to predict production flow and neuralnetwork input also with the region, create a big image size to represent almost every info or part of it.
